# v2-Ch-2-Adv-CSS-Portfolio

## Challenge Description
A portfolio of work can showcase one's skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights one's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. This week's challenge focuses on building a portfolio from scratch that holds past and future projects, with a focus on flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. 

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
