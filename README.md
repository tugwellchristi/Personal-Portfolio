# Personal Portfolio Site

## Portfolio Description
This is my personal portfolio website that provides information about me, my work history, resume and some of my work from my MS program in Art and Technology that I completed this May. As I built this site, I focused on using basic HTML and expanding my knowledge of CSS properties, specifically flexbox and media queries. My goal was to build a basic shell, style it, and update it as I have more pieces to showcase and add more stylistic detail and functionality as my programming skills grow. 

## User Story
My goal is to create a portfolio page that will display desired skills in HTML and CSS, display projects and showcase other competencies to future employers. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Some of the criteria I wanted to make sure was included is as follows: 
- Upon deploying the site, my name, avatar, and contact information would be included in sections with clickable links. 
- When clicking on one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When clicking on the link to the section about work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.
- When displaying my first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- When clicking on the images of the applications, I am taken to the desired deployed application.
- When resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices, I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
